## Creating Digital Experiences with Liferay

It's no secret that, in order to keep up with an ever-evolving market, today's businesses need more effective ways to engage with their customers, partners, and allies. Customers have higher expectations for companies in which they decide to invest. They want faster speeds, fewer clicks, and more information at their fingertips on any device, so businesses need to find software that will equip them to give customers what they want.

The kind of software a business chooses should allow them to implement many, if not all, of the following: 
* **Partner Portals** for partners, suppliers, agents, franchises, and other trusted allies
* **Intranets** that make sense for the industry and connect with other systems so employees can better serve customers
* **Customer Portals** that make it easy for customers to get things done while reducing the cost of supporting them
* **Public-Facing Websites** that are personalized to specific audiences and specific needs
* **Integration Platforms** that unify systems, data, and processes 
* **Enterprise Solutions Factories** that efficiently produce new apps and websites built on one platform
