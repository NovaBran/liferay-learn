## Using Felix Web Console

Apache Felix Web Console is a web-based OSGi container management tool. It provides a graphical user interface for the most common bundle management tasks, like installing, uninstalling, starting, and stopping the bundles and checking bundle configuration. Apache Felix Web Console lacks advanced features like scripting. Like the Gogo Shell, Apache Felix Web Console is extensible.

Although a web-based management interface is often convenient, using Felix Web Console in a production should generally be avoided because of the potential security risks involved with web access.
