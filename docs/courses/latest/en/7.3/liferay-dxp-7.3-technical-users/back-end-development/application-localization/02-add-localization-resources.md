# Add Localization Resources

<div class="ahead">

## Exercise Goals

- Review portlet component properties
- Change the localization file encoding
- Provide localization resources
- Test the user interface

</div>

Take a look at the component properties of `GradebookPortlet.java`. See the resource bundle property:

```java
@Component(
	immediate = true,
	property = {
		"com.liferay.portlet.display-category=category.training",
		"com.liferay.portlet.instanceable=false",
		"javax.portlet.display-name=Gradebook",
		"javax.portlet.init-param.template-path=/",
		"javax.portlet.init-param.view-template=/view.jsp",
		"javax.portlet.name=" + GradebookPortletKeys.Gradebook,
		"javax.portlet.resource-bundle=content.Language",
		"javax.portlet.security-role-ref=power-user,user",
		"javax.portlet.init-param.add-process-action-success-action=false"
	},
	service = Portlet.class
)
public class GradebookPortlet extends MVCPortlet {
}
```

The value of the property translates to a file system path `src/main/resources/content/Language.properties`, which was done automatically by the module template. By setting this property, localization resources of `Language.properties` are available for Liferay JSP tag libraries automatically. To add support for another language, let's say for German, just add a new language properties file `src/main/resources/content/Language_de_DE.properties`.

Default encoding for the language text files is ISO-8859-1. While it usually works for English, localizations for other languages with non-standard ASCII special characters will break.

Let's change the file encoding to UTF-8.

## Change the Localization File Encoding
1. **Right-click** on the `src/main/resources/content/Language.properties` file in the *gradebook-web*.
1. **Click** on *Properties*.
1. **Change** the *Text file encoding* to UTF-8 and close the dialog.

## Provide Localization Resources
1. **Open** the `gradebook-web/src/main/resources/content/Language.properties` file.
1. **Implement** the file as follows:

```properties
#
# This is the default localization file containing the key to display messages mappings.
#

#
# Standard portlet display messages
#
javax.portlet.description.com_liferay_training_gradebook_web_portlet_GradebookPortlet=Gradebook 
javax.portlet.display-name.com_liferay_training_gradebook_web_portlet_GradebookPortlet=Gradebook

## Test the User Interface
1. **Go to** localhost:8080 in your browser.
* **Open** the Gradebook application.
* **Refresh** the page.
	- You should now be able to see the labels and messages correctly:

<br />

<img src="images/localizations_in_place.png" style="max-width:50%;" />
