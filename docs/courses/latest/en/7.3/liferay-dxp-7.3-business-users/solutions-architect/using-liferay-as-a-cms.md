* A Liferay DXP or CE 7.3 instance up and running 
    - If you have not started your instance yet, first, make sure you have installed Docker. Then, use the following commands to get and start the Liferay Docker Image: 
        * `docker pull liferay/[product]:[version]`
        * `docker run -it -m 8g -p 8080:8080 liferay/[product]:[version]`
