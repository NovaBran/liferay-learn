* A Liferay DXP 7.4 instance up and running
    - If you have not started your instance yet, first, make sure you have downloaded Docker, then use the following commands to get and start the Liferay Docker Image: 
        * `docker pull liferay/[product]:[version]`
        * `docker run -it -m 8g -p 8080:8080 liferay/[product]:[version]`

        * Portal Name: Marvin Robotics
        * First Name: Test
        * Last Name: Test
        * Email: test@marvinrobotics.com
